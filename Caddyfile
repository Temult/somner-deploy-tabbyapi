# Caddy Webserver Configuration
# ==============================================================================
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This file configures the Caddy webserver to act as a simple reverse proxy.
# It listens on the container's public port 80 and forwards all traffic
# to the TabbyAPI server running internally on port 5000.
#

{
  # RATIONALE: Disable automatic HTTPS certificate generation. SSL/TLS termination
  # is handled by upstream services (like TailscaleHeadscale, RunPod's proxy or 
  # another load balancer).
  auto_https off
}

# Listen on port 80 for all incoming HTTP requests.
:80 {
  # Forward all requests to the TabbyAPI server.
  reverse_proxy localhost:5000
